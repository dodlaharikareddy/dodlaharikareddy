<h3 align="center">💻 Software Engineer who loves designing systems that make life easier — and code that feels like poetry.</h3>

### ✨ What Defines Me

🌱 I’m endlessly curious — the kind of developer who reads about distributed tracing over coffee ☕️  
⚙️ I don’t just “use” tools like Java, Spring Boot, or Kubernetes — I **break, fix, and reimagine** them.  
🌎 I love working on **problems that scale**, **systems that talk**, and **teams that collaborate**.  
💡 My engineering rule: *If it can be automated, it should be.*

### 🧩 My Engineering Philosophy

> “Code should not only work — it should explain itself.”  

- I write for **clarity first**, optimization second.  
- I believe in **observability by design** — metrics, logs, traces should tell a story.  
- I see DevOps not as a role, but as a **culture of ownership**.  
- I treat bugs as breadcrumbs — each one leading me to a smarter pattern.

### 🔮 What I’m Building / Exploring Right Now

- 💬 Creating lightweight **AI-powered microservices** that connect internal APIs with LLMs.  
- ☁️ Designing **event-driven architectures** using **Kafka + AWS Lambda** for scalable async flows.  
- 📊 Experimenting with **OpenTelemetry** for fine-grained visibility into distributed systems.  
- 🧠 Learning more about **clean architecture**, **DDD**, and how great systems tell stories through their data flow.

### 🛠️ My Favorite Stack (and why I love it)

| Tool | Why it’s my favorite |
|------|-----------------------|
| 🧩 **Spring Boot** | Opinionated yet flexible — it’s like jazz for backend developers. |
| ☸️ **Kubernetes** | Because watching a pod heal itself feels like magic. |
| ⚡ **Kafka** | I love seeing data streams behave like conversations between microservices. |
| ☁️ **AWS Lambda** | My go-to for elegant, event-driven automation. |
| 📈 **Grafana + Prometheus** | Where debugging meets art. |

### 🖋️ A Bit Beyond Code

🎧 Music fuels my focus — lo-fi + instrumental = deep coding zone.  
📸 I love capturing small details (sunsets, reflections, code aesthetics).  
💬 My best work happens when a team brainstorm turns into a whiteboard storm.  
🌍 I enjoy mentoring juniors — explaining “why” more than “how”.

### ⚡ Fun (and random) Facts

- I’ve broken production — **and fixed it faster than my coffee cooled** ☕️  
- I debug Java stack traces like they’re detective stories.  
- I name my Kubernetes clusters after planets 🌍🪐.  
- I once optimized a microservice so well it *accidentally exposed an unused bottleneck upstream*. 😅
